# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml
trigger:
- main  

pool:
  name: development  # Your agent pool name
  demands: Agent.Name -equals LAPTOP-SM2SURAK  # Specify the exact agent name

steps:
- script: echo "Running on LAPTOP-SM2SURAK"
  displayName: 'Run a script on a specific agent'


# Add more steps as needed
